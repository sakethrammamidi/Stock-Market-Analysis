# Stock-Market-Analysis

📊 Stock Market Analysis Using Python 🐍
This project is a guide to understanding stock behavior over time, helping us answer questions like: What makes stock prices go up or down? How are different companies’ stocks connected?

🔎 What’s Inside?
This project uses Python to gather, explore, and visualize stock data from Yahoo Finance. Here’s how it works:

Get Real-Time Stock Data 📈: We use a tool called the yfinance API to download stock data for popular companies like Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, and Google. This lets us study stock trends over the past three months.

Visualize Stock Performance 📊: With charts, we track each company’s performance and see how their stock prices change over time.

Analyze Moving Averages 📏: By looking at 10-day and 20-day moving averages, we can see trends in stock prices, helping us understand whether a stock is trending up or down.

Measure Volatility 🌪️: Volatility shows us how much a stock price changes over time. High volatility means big ups and downs, while low volatility means smaller, steadier changes.

Find Connections Between Stocks 🔗: We explore how different stocks relate, especially between companies like Apple and Microsoft. By comparing their prices, we can see if they move in the same way.

📝 Summary
This project gives a clearer picture of the stock market by:

Finding trends with moving averages 📉
Measuring price changes with volatility 🌡️
Seeing which companies move together 🔗
With these insights, we get a better understanding of stock performance and the connections between companies.
